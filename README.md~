# Introduction
MuMoSS (**Mu**lti**Mo**dal **S**cene **S**egmentator) is a video scene segmentator based on audiovisual features. The program features a set of different algorithms, using both the late and early fusion approaches.

# Requirements
*	A C++11 compatible compiler, like gcc
*	A functional OpenCV installation (version 2.4.x and above, SIFT suport is a must have!)
*   	An appropriate set of CODECs (for video decoding)
*	Armadillo library v6.600+ (Avaliable at http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
*	

# Supported algorithms
## Simple Late Fusion (*slf*)
A simple late fusion based algorithm built upon Bag of Features dictionaries for both aural and visual features. After the dictionaries' are created with the specified size, a histogram are estimated for each keyframe/shot based on nearest neighbor method. The histograms are used to calculate the dissimilarity of adjacent shots and, if a similarity valley are found, a scene transition is detected.

## Simple Early Fusion (*sef*)

# Caveats
		1. The MD5 algorithm may requires a lot of RAM when the *generate temporary files* switch is on.
		2. This program may require a high amount of available memory. Typical values range from 2GB to 4GB for a 2h length 480p video.
		2. The high memory consumption is directly linked with the video length and resolution. When facing memory problems, try to segment a smaller video with lower resolution.
